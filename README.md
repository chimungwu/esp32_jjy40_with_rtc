# ESP32 JJY 40kHz Transmitter with DS3231 RTC & LCD Display (ver.0.12)

> A robust and extended version of the original ESP32 JJY simulator, upgraded with DS3231 RTC backup, LCD1602 display, WiFiManager config UI, and microsecond-aligned NTP time sync.

This project simulates a JJY 40kHz radio transmitter using ESP32, with precise time synchronization via NTP and fallback to DS3231 RTC. A 16x2 LCD shows current time and transmission status. Configuration is made easy using WiFiManager for timezone and WiFi credentials.

## 🔧 Features

- 🛰️ **WiFi + NTP Time Synchronization**  
  On boot, the device attempts to connect to known WiFi and sync with NTP servers (Taiwan, Google, Pool). Microsecond-level precision is applied for second alignment.

- 🕒 **RTC Fallback with DS3231**  
  If WiFi/NTP fails, the system reads from DS3231 RTC to continue accurate timekeeping.

- 📶 **JJY 40kHz Signal Generation**  
  Uses GPIO26 with LEDC PWM output at 40kHz to transmit JJY standard time codes encoded in pulse width.

- ⚙️ **WiFiManager Web Configuration**  
  Auto-starts "JJY_Config" AP if WiFi is not available. Users can set WiFi and timezone (+8, +9, etc.) via web page.

- 📺 **LCD1602 I2C Display Support**  
  - Top row: Taiwan time (fixed UTC+8) + sync source (NTP or RTC)  
  - Bottom row: Transmit time + current timezone

- 🧠 **Error Handling & Logging**  
  Serial monitor displays full debug info: NTP retries, RTC time validity, sg[] bit values, fallback logic, and more.

## 🖥️ Hardware Requirements

| Component        | Notes                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ESP32 Dev Board  | e.g., NodeMCU-32S or DevKit v1         |
| DS3231 RTC       | I²C on GPIO17 (SDA) and GPIO16 (SCL)   |
| LCD1602 Display  | I²C on GPIO21 (SDA) and GPIO22 (SCL)   |
| Loop Antenna     | Connected via 220Ω to GPIO26 and GND   |
| (Optional) LED   | GPIO2 lights up when WiFi is connected |

## 🗂️ Pin Assignments

| Purpose          | GPIO | Description                  |
|------------------|------|------------------------------|
| PWM Output (TX)  | 26   | 40kHz signal to antenna       |
| WiFi Status LED  | 2    | Lights when WiFi connected    |
| LCD I2C SDA/SCL  | 21/22| Default I2C port (Wire)       |
| RTC I2C SDA/SCL  | 17/16| Separate I2C port (I2C1)      |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Connect DS3231 RTC and LCD1602 as described above  
2. Connect antenna (loop wire) to GPIO26 via 220Ω to GND  
3. Upload the sketch via Arduino IDE (baud rate: 115200)  
4. On first boot, the device will enter "JJY_Config" AP mode  
5. Use browser to connect, configure WiFi & timezone (e.g., +8 for Taiwan)  
6. Once configured, it will auto sync time and begin transmission

## 📡 JJY Signal Format (Simplified)

| Type       | Pulse Width | Meaning                  |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `-1` / `255` | 0.2 sec     | Minute marker             |
| `0`        | 0.8 sec     | Bit 0                    |
| `1`        | 0.5 sec     | Bit 1                    |

## 📦 Future Plans

- ⏳ Minute offset support (e.g., +8:15)  
- 🔘 Button-controlled transmission mode  
- 🔁 BPC (China 68.5kHz) mode toggle
